d)       [3 marks] Write a C++ function named multiPersistArr that takes a static array of integer and its size n as arguments and populates the array with the multiplicative persistence of the first n integers greater than or equal to 0, [0, n -1]. 
(You must call your function defined in part c) when answering this question).

 

----------------------------------------



e)      [4 marks] Write a C++ program (main function) that declares a static array of size 1000 and populates the array with multiplicative persistence of the numbers from 0 to 999. Then it finds and prints ALL the numbers in the range [0, 999] that have the multiplicative persistence of 5 by using the function findIndex defined in part b. (You must use your functions defined in parts b) and d) when answering this question).

 You are NOT allowed to call your function muliPersist defined in part c) when answering this question.
